## Code Explanation

Let's dive into some key parts of the code that power this e-store application.

### Routes (`routes/web.php`)

"Here in `routes/web.php`, I've defined all the web routes for our application. This file acts as the traffic controller, directing incoming requests to the appropriate functions in our controllers.

We have routes for:

-   **Product Browsing:** Displaying the main product list, and specific categories like keyboards and laptops.
-   **Product Details:** Showing individual product pages.
-   **Cart Management:** Routes for adding items to the cart, viewing the cart, and removing items.
-   **User Authentication & Profile:** Standard routes for login, registration, and managing user profiles.
-   **Admin Panel:** A dedicated group of routes under the `/admin` prefix, protected by an `admin` middleware, which allows administrators to manage products, users, and categories using resource controllers."

### Product Controller (`app/Http/Controllers/ProductController.php`)

"The `ProductController` is responsible for handling all product-related logic.

-   The `index` function fetches all products to display on the main product listing page.
-   Functions like `keyboards` and `laptops` demonstrate how we can filter products by category. They query the `Category` model to find the relevant category and then retrieve its associated products using Eloquent relationships.
-   The `addToCart` function is crucial for our e-commerce functionality. When a user adds an item to the cart, this function first checks if the product is in stock. If it is, it decreases the product's stock count in the database and then stores the item in the user's session. It also updates a running total for the cart price, all managed within the session for simplicity."

### Cart Logic (`app/Http/Controllers/CartController.php`)

"The `CartController` manages the shopping cart's state and operations.

-   The `index` function simply displays the cart contents, which are retrieved from the user's session.
-   The `remove` function handles the removal of items from the cart. When an item is removed, it updates the session to reflect the change, adjusts the total cart price, and importantly, restores the stock count of the product in the database. This ensures that product availability is accurately maintained."
